Embark on an quest through an endless dungeon filled with ferocious foes! As the hero, you must use all of your skills to escape!

But beware, for the dungeon is infested with deadly skeletons, scary goblins, and fearsome trolls, all eager to put an end to your quest. Armed only with your trusty gun and quick reflexes, you must face down these enemies in a battle for survival.

Luckily for a limited time, the hero will be granted a pair of magnificent wings that grant them the power of flight! Soar through the air, dodging enemy attacks and launching devastating counterstrikes.

Will you be the one to triumph over this endless dungeon, or will you fall victim to the Brucenning and the monstrous guardians? The fate of the world rests in your hands!

## Technical Project Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project are outlined here to give you a starting point. Meeting the minimum requirements alone will not guarantee you a good mark. You are welcome to meet and exceed the minimum requirements if you have good, creative ideas and would like to discuss them with me.

**Requirement 1**: The project must incorporate some visual interface using Processing.org libraries. All user interaction must be conducted via this interface.

**Requirement 2**: The project must incorporate some kind of non-blocking concurrent/asynchronous processing that happens at regular intervals. For example, you might push or fetch data from in the background.

**Requirement 3**: The project must incorporate some kind of non-trivial persistent data state that must be read, processed, and written at regular intervals. For example, you might save a game state in a JSON file. This may or may not be included with Requirement 2.

**Requirement 4**: The project must incorporate some kind of self-managing custom iterable data structure. For example, you might have a collection of enemies that are added and deleted based on statistics maintained by the data structure.

**Requirement 5**: The project must be well-documented, complete, and run without errors on final submission.


## Final Project Demo (group, 1%)

The Final Project Demo will be a working version of your project that you will present to your lab section for review. The demo will be in lab, and will include a live demo of the working application, and a short code review. There are no slides required, but you should have practiced your demo to make sure it will run reasonably well. This will be during the last lab of class.

No submission.

## Final README.md (group, 1%)

The Final README.md must give instructions on how to run your program, a list of contributions by each member, and any references/citations for code you may have used from elsewhere. 

Submission is here, on GitHub, in the `README.md` file.

## Final Product (group, 5%)

The Final Product will be evaluated for overall code design and documentation and evaluated on the same design principles as individual contributions. If you are below the 1000 line minimum contribution, your mark will be scaled down for this portion.

Submission is here, on GitHub.

## Code Contributions (individual, 15%)

You will be expected to take on a significant individual contribution to the group project (at least 1000 lines of non-trivial code). It may be in a number of forms, but here are some examples:

Contributions must be for functional, working Java code and must be continuous throughout the term. You may not, for example, push all of your changes at the end of term. Code will be marked on following good design principles, i.e., SOLID, design patterns, etc. You are encouraged to work together and use pair programming for components, but you will be marked on your contribution to your own modules individually.

## Documentation Contributions (individual, 5%)

Your code must be well-documented with fully-formed method signatures, comments, and necessary README or Wiki pages. This is further broken down into the following.

### Documentation contributions (3%)
Your personal feature documentation, wherever it happens to show up in the final documentation.

Due with final submission.

## Issues and Pull Request Contributions (individual, 5%)
You must track your own work in the form of creating and closing GitHub issues, creating and reviewing pull requests, responding to issues that have been assigned to you, and creating issues that you assign to others (all within reason).
